# Flight Departure Delay Prediction

## **Problem Statement**
Flight departure delays are a critical challenge in the aviation industry. Delays impact passenger satisfaction, airline operations, and overall efficiency. The goal of this project is to predict departure delays using raw datasets, including train, test, and weather data. The project involves analyzing delay patterns, building predictive models, and generating predictions for a Kaggle competition.

## **Objective**
The main goal is to predict departure delays for flights in the test dataset by:
1. Analyzing the provided datasets (train, test, and weather data).
2. Building predictive models based on the train dataset.
3. Generating predictions for the test dataset.
4. Submitting predictions to a Kaggle competition for evaluation.

## **Project Phases**
The project is divided into five phases:

### **Phase 1: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**
#### **1. Data Integration**
- Integrate the weather dataset with the training dataset for further processing.

#### **2. Data Cleaning and Transformation**
- Handle missing values.
- Format time fields (e.g., Scheduled, Actual, Estimated Time) into a standard datetime format for consistency.

#### **3. Feature Engineering**
- **Calculate Departure Delay:** Compute the departure delay for each flight.
- **Merge Weather Data:** Extract relevant weather features (e.g., temperature, wind speed) and join them with flight data.
- **Extract Temporal Features:** Derive additional features such as:
  - Day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
  - Hour of the day.
  - Month of the year.

### **Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
#### **1. Visualizations**
- **Delay Distributions:**
  - Histogram of delay durations.
- **Temporal Analysis:**
  - Line plots or bar charts showing delays across hours, days, or months.
- **Category-Wise Analysis:**
  - Group delays by airline, departure airport, or flight status.

#### **2. Correlation Analysis**
- Analyze the relationship between weather and flight data through at least three different visualizations.

#### **3. Comparison**
- Compare delays across training and testing datasets to check for data consistency.

### **Phase 3: Analytical and Predictive Tasks**
#### **1. Classification Tasks**
##### **Binary Classification**
- **Objective:** Classify flights as on-time or delayed.
  - **On-time:** Delay = 0
  - **Delayed:** Delay > 0
- **Steps:**
  1. Train a binary classification model.
  2. Evaluate performance using metrics such as:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision-Recall
     - F1-Score
     - Class-wise Precision-Recall
     - Confusion Matrix

##### **Multi-Class Classification**
- **Objective:** Categorize flights into different delay categories:
  - No Delay (0 min)
  - Short Delay (<45 min)
  - Moderate Delay (45â€“175 min)
  - Long Delay (>175 min)
- **Steps:**
  1. Train a multi-class classification model.
  2. Evaluate performance using metrics such as:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision-Recall
     - F1-Score
     - Class-wise Precision-Recall
     - Confusion Matrix

#### **2. Regression Analysis**
##### **Delay Duration Prediction**
- **Objective:** Predict the exact delay duration for each flight.
- **Steps:**
  1. Train a regression model.
  2. Validate models using cross-validation techniques.
  3. Evaluate performance using:
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

### **Phase 4: Model Optimization and Evaluation**
#### **1. Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Use techniques like grid search or random search to optimize the models.

#### **2. Validation**
- Apply k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance.

#### **3. Model Comparison**
- Compare the performance of different models to select the best one.

### **Phase 5: Model Testing**
#### **1. Predictions on Test Dataset**
- Use the trained models to make predictions on the test dataset.
- Save predictions in the Kaggle submission format:
  - **Regression:** Predict the exact delay.
  - **Classification:** Predict delay categories or binary outcomes (on-time/delayed).
  - Ensure the delay column contains data in string format (e.g., "on-time" or "delayed") and not numeric values.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** for data analysis and model building.
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn** for building predictive models.
- **Kaggle** for submission and evaluation.

## **Evaluation Metrics**
- **Classification Models:**
  - Accuracy
  - Precision-Recall
  - F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

- **Regression Models:**
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

## **Challenges Faced**
1. Handling missing values in the dataset.
2. Integrating weather data with flight data.
3. Feature engineering to extract meaningful temporal and weather-based features.
4. Balancing the dataset for classification tasks.
5. Selecting the best models and hyperparameter tuning.

## **Future Improvements**
1. Incorporate additional data sources for better predictions (e.g., air traffic data).
2. Use advanced machine learning models like XGBoost or Neural Networks.
3. Implement automated feature selection techniques.
4. Improve the efficiency of the preprocessing pipeline.
